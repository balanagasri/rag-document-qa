# RAG-Based Document Question Answering System 🤖📄

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions based on the content, and receive accurate, document-specific answers. It combines the power of **Cohere** for language processing and embeddings, **Pinecone** for efficient vector storage and retrieval, and **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.

---

## Features ✨

- **PDF Processing**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF documents and splits it into manageable chunks for embedding and storage.  
- **Embedding and Retrieval**: Uses Cohere's embeddings for encoding document chunks and Pinecone for scalable vector similarity search.  
- **Question Answering**: Leverages Cohere's language models to generate accurate responses by retrieving and analyzing relevant document chunks.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface using Streamlit for uploading documents, entering queries, and viewing results.

## How to Use 🚀

Follow the steps below to run and interact with the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local system using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivekChauhan05/RAG_Document_Question_Answering.git
cd RAG_Document_Question_Answering
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment 🏗️
Create a virtual environment and activate it to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies 📦
Install the required Python libraries using the provided requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Obtain API Keys 🔑
Get your API keys for:

- Cohere: Sign up at Cohere to obtain an API key.
- Pinecone: Sign up at Pinecone to obtain an API key.
These keys will be entered via the Streamlit interface when running the app.

### 5. Run the Application 🏃‍♂️

Launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
cd src
streamlit run app.py
```

### 6. Access the Application 🌐
Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit, typically http://localhost:8501.

### 7. Upload a Document 📄
Use the interface to upload a PDF file containing the content you want to query.

### 8. Ask Questions ❓
- Enter your question in the query box. The chatbot will:

- Retrieve relevant chunks of text from the uploaded document.
- Generate a precise and context-aware response.
